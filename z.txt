 Saturday April 29th notes:

 So, I can create a user, and the login works correctly. When I 
 create a new user, the redirect stops working. I think this 
 has something to do with the authform component pushing to /home. 
 I think following the tutorial might find a solution for that. 
 Regardless, the user IS being created as I can see the new users 
 I made in the railway database I have hosted. When I manually 
 changed the environment variable's secret key, the redirect worked 
 as expected once again until I registered for a new user. This means 
 it's also an issue with the cookies. I'm guessing it's keeping those 
 cookies ( the user logged in ) and that's why the redirect isn't working, 
 because it's only going to redirect to the sign in page if they aren't logged in. 
 Pretty interesting yet annoying issue though.
